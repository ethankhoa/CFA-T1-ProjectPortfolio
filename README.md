The planning process included:

* Mood Board
* Paper Wireframes and sketches
* Colour Palette Research
* Trello Task Board

<h3 id="ideas">Ideas</h3>

Going through the mood board process I found that the designs that I was drawn too were the more basic and to the point designs. Many themes that I came across that were featured were very image heavy and were for mostly front end developers and UX designers. During this process I have learned that I am not a graphic designer nor a male model.

<h3 id="colours">Colours</h3>

I suffer from deuteranopia, which is a type of red-green colour blindness where green cones do not detect enough green and are too sensitive to yellows, oranges, and reds.

Which causes greens, yellows, oranges, reds, and browns to appear very similar, especially in low light. It also makes it difficult to tell the difference between certain hues of blues and purples, or pinks and grays.

I wanted to have a colour palette that is easily viewable for people with similar conditions.

These are the color palettes that I worked from and ultimately chose the 12 color palette.
